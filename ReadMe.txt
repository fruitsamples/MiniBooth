Quartz Composer Application

MiniBooth					A very simplified Photo Booth that shows how to combine 
						the Composition Repository with the Composition Loader 
						patch to apply image filtering on video output, and how 
						to save the QCView contents as a PNG image file.

Sample Requirements				The project was created using the Xcode running under 
						Mac OS X 10.6.x or later. The supplied Quartz Composer 
						compositions were created using the Quartz Composer editor 
						running under Mac OS X 10.6.x or later.

About the sample				In the sample, the user can select an image filter in the 
						composition picker to generate videos with special effects. 
						The supplied composition grabs the input video and output 
						a sequence of images. The images are then processed with an 
						image filter selected by the user to produce video with 
						special effects. A QCCompositionPickerPanel is used to 
						provide the image filters for the user to select. When a filter 
						is selected, the application will receive a notification and 
						it will pass the selected filter identifier as the new input 
						parameter for the composition in the QCView. This filter is 
						then applied to process the images.

Using the Sample				Open the project using the Xcode editor which can be found in 
						/Developer/Applications. Build the project and run. Select the 
						image filter from the composition picker to see the new results.
